### Sprint Burndown Chart [^1]

![](http://li657-9.members.linode.com/scrumreferencecard-content/uploads/2013/03/Sprint-Burndown-Chart.png)

* Indicates total remaining team task hours within one Sprint
* Re-estimated daily, thus may go up before going down
* Intended to facilitate team self-organization
* Fancy variations, such as itemizing by point person or adding trend lines, tend to reduce effectiveness at encouraging collaboration
* Seemed like a good idea in the early days of Scrum, but in practice has often been misused as a management report, inviting intervention. The ScrumMaster should discontinue use of this chart if it becomes an impediment to team self-organization.
